Adjacency matrix for the I=88 Ohio counties in WinBUGS format

num = vector giving number of adjacencies for each county
adj = vector giving actual adjacencies, one row for each county
sumNumNeigh = total number of adjacencies for all counties

Example:  First row of "adj" corresponds to County 1 (Adams).
It is adjacent to 4 other counties:  Counties 8, 36, 66, and 73.
